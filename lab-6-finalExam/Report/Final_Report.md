## Sample sites

1. https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes

   - Likes:
     - Landing page is very impressive, which can help user immediately understand the main topic of this this company. The interactive map can also inspire interest of user.
     - The Q&A section uses toggle bars, which I think is an amazing idea. It shows all the questions clearly so that users can quickly locate the question they need. In addition, it avoids placing too much text on one page, which might cause confusion and look messy.
   - Dislikes:
     - There is no navigation bar on the top of the page. It make the web page looks clearer, but decrease the convenience of user to explore the whole usage and information of this website. 
     - There may be a better implementation of the table about the comparison with own products and competitors. When I scroll down the page to a view the whole table, the table header cannot be displayed at the same time. So I need to scroll backwards to check the column headers.
   - How influenced:
     - I have also applied a toggle bar in my Q&A section. Lists the normal problems that users may encounter while running this project and the solutions to them. It also provides navigation to tools that may be needed.
     - Add an interactive bar chart that displays the test results in an attractive way that users can view at their preferred angle.

   - Likes:
     - Very clear and well artfully designed navigation bar. It also has active feedback when the pointer is hovering over a selection. In addition, it even has split columns in some of the extended menus.
     - Landing page contains a large simple artwork, and few words point out the main idea of this website.
     - The introduction section is presented with alternating left and right graphics and descriptions. The animated graphics allow users to quickly visualize the features and increase their appeal.
   - Dislikes:
     - The top navigation bar is not always fixed when previewing the content below. Since the page is quite long, it might be more convenient to have a navigation to a different location, or a button to go back to the top.
     - Perhaps more interactive buttons or sliders could be added to the main content to give users a sense of exploration and increase their interest in browsing.
   - How influenced:
     - Displays the main function descriptions in the same layout, alternating between left and right. Some animated graphics are also included to better demonstrate complex functions.
     - In a similar design, a fixed navigation bar is added to the page. You can easily jump to any position at any time. A button to go back to the top of the page is also available in the bottom right corner of the web page.
     - Flat page design, as clean and simple as possible, with blue as the main color. Users can immediately understand the theme and function of the website.
